## aboutMe = 

*Hello github!* ðŸ˜„ My name is Arzuffi Dario, an italian aspiring smart contract developer. Born in 1998, I always loved the idea of learning how to design and code programs that can solve people's problems. I got close and started playing with cryptocurrencies and web3 at the start of 2022, and I recently deep dove into **solidity** and **smart contract development**, which I absolutely fell in love with.

## education = 

1. At the end of Feb 2022, I received my Bachelor Degree in Chemistry at UNIMI (UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano), with a final grade of 95/110.
2. From this point on, I started learning web3, finance and later during the year programming by myself, handpicking YouTube and MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses and appreciating the open source opportunities.
