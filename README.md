# Fendross

My name is Arzuffi Dario, an italian aspiring smart contract developer. Born in 1998, I always loved the idea of learning how to design and code programs that can solve people's problems. I got close and started playing with cryptocurrencies and web3 at the start of 2022, and I recently deep dove into **Solidity** and **Smart Contract Development**, which I absolutely fell in love with.
