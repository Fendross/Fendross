# About Me üíª

My name is Arzuffi Dario, an italian aspiring software engineer. Born in 1998, I always loved the idea of learning how to design and code programs that can solve people's problems. I got interested in the blockchain technology at the start of 2022, and later during the year I deep dove into **Solidity** and **Smart Contract Development**. After that, I looked more deeply into **Software** **Development**, which I fell in love with.

I'm currently studying and developing my personal projects, which will be soon published. I hope you will enjoy them ‚ù§Ô∏è
