# About Me 🗓️

My name is Arzuffi Dario and I'm a Software Engineer.
Born in 1998, I got my Bachelor Degree in Chemistry in February 2022.

I always loved the idea of learning how to design and code programs that can solve people's problems. I got interested in the blockchain technology at the start of 2022, and later during the year I deep dove into it by playing around with Solidity and smart contract development.
After that, noticing there were too many things I wasn't grasping so well, I took the chance to reset my path and I started learning the basics of Computer Science, assembling a study plan using open source courses with the goal of changing my career definitively. I would lie if I said it was an easy route to follow, but in the end it was pure satisfaction and I got a strong passion out of it!
