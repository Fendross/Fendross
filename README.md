# About Me ðŸ’»

My name is Arzuffi Dario and I'm a Junior Software Developer. Born in 1998, I got my Bachelor Degree in Chemistry in Feb 2022.
I always loved the idea of learning how to design and code programs that can solve people's problems. I got interested in the blockchain technology at the start of 2022, and later during the year I deep dove into it by playing around with Solidity and Smart Contract development. After that, seeing that there were too many things I wasn't grasping so well, I reset my path and started learning the basics of Computer Science, assembling a study plan using open source courses with the goal of changing my career definitely.

I'm currently working, and when I have time I study and develop my personal projects. I hope you will enjoy them!
